I'm a graphics programmer from Brazil, currently working on **Wind/Tempest** - a experimental x86_64 operating system.

## ðŸ”¥ Currently Working On

### **Vortox** ![Uncertain](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Uncertain-lightgrey)
A modern, high-performance 3D game engine built with C++ that focuses on:
- Advanced rendering techniques using OpenGL
- Data-oriented design for optimal performance

### **Wind/Tempest** ![Active](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-success)
A modern, minimal OS, that actually works, built in x86 ASM and C that focuses on:
- Native legacy DOS compatibility layer (SoulDOS)
- And many other things to come later!
