# Hello! I'm Russian95 üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an enthusiastic developer from Brazil, currently working on the **Vortox**, a highly optimized 3D game engine. Here you will find some of my main projects.

## üî• Currently Working On

### **[Vortox](#)**
I‚Äôm currently developing **Vortox**, a 3D game engine optimized for performance and designed to push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in real-time graphics. It‚Äôs built with OpenGL and focuses on a highly efficient raycasting engine. Stay tuned for more updates! I am making the Engine with isaquemota, trypr0x and me.
