# Hello! I'm Russian95 ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an enthusiastic developer from Curitiba, currently working on the **Inferno Engine**, a highly optimized 3D game engine. In addition to my work on game development, I focus on optimizations, customizations, and innovations in operating systems and software. Here you will find some of my main projects, each reflecting my commitment to quality, efficiency, and the constant pursuit of a smoother user experience.

## ðŸ”¥ Currently Working On

### **[Zypher](#)**
Iâ€™m currently developing **Zypher**, a 3D game engine optimized for performance and designed to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in real-time graphics. Itâ€™s built with OpenGL and focuses on a highly efficient raycasting engine. Stay tuned for more updates! I am making the Engine with isaquemota, and me.
